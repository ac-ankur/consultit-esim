            The “Service” is available for purchase exclusively using the
            www.Esim.in sales channel on an authorized device. The Service may
            not be available in all areas and on all devices and is subject to
            these T&C’s.<br/>These T&C’s, including the provisions regarding the
            personal data protection referenced herein (collectively, the
            “Agreement”), set forth the T&C’s that apply to your use of the
            Service. “Customer”, “You” and “your” mean the customer of the
            Service defined above, and “Esim.in”, “we”, “our”, and “us”
            include partner network and any of its affiliates involved in
            providing You with the Service.<br/> Your enrolment in, use of or payment
            for the Service, confirms your unconditional acceptance and
            agreement to the T&C’s set forth in this Agreement available on

            may not use the Service. This Agreement may change. We may modify or
            amend this Agreement from time to time. Unless otherwise provided in
            this Agreement, all such modifications or amendments shall be
            effective immediately upon posting on Esim.in (the “Website”).
            Where we make a significant change to this Agreement, we will
            endeavor to separately notify You about this change. YOUR CONTINUED
            USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER THE POSTING ON THE WEBSITE WILL BE
            CONCLUSIVELY DEEMED TO BE ACCEPTANCE BY YOU OF ANY SUCH
            MODIFICATIONS OR AMENDMENTS.<br/> By purchasing the Service, You agree
            that You are authorized to use the Service and are responsible for
            paying for the Service per these T&C’s.<br/> The Service consists in
            providing prepaid cellular Data and Voice Plans (allowance of voice
            and data valid for a certain duration) to enable connecting your
            device to the Internet (the “Tariff Plans”).<br/> The countries in which
            You can use the Tariff Plans are listed where You browse through
            available offers. Available offers may change from time to time and
            may depend on the country You are currently in.<br/> To support the
            Service, Esim has entered into agreements with various cellular
            carriers (mobile operators) around the world to access their
            cellular networks (collectively referred to as the “Mobile
            Network”).

            revocable, non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable, license to use the
            Service that is not transferable for use on another device, subject

          <p>
            This Agreement will commence, and a binding contract will exist
            between Esim.in and the Customer when the Customer starts using
            the Service. It will continue until terminated as set forth herein.
            The Service is sold exclusively on a prepaid basis. All services,
            including any related offers and promotions may be subject to

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Our obligations</h2>
          <p>
            Esim will provide the Service in accordance with the Agreement,
            and as per the applicable Tariff Plan description, and from the date
            the Customer starts using the Service or purchases such Tariff Plan.<br/>
            We will try to make sure that the Service is available to You
            wherever possible; however both availability and quality of the
            Service may be affected by things we cannot control such as physical
            obstructions, atmospheric conditions and outages on the Mobile
            Network (the infrastructure, software and hardware enabling a
            cellular carrier / mobile operator to support wireless internet
            services offered to subscribers) where such outages and their
            remedies are not within our control.<br/> We or our mobile operator
            partners (any company operating a mobile internet network, which
            owns or controls all the elements necessary to sell and deliver
            mobile internet services) may from time to time need to carry out
            upgrade or maintenance work on the Mobile Network which may affect
            the availability and/or quality of the Service.<br/> We will endeavour to
            keep such disruption to a minimum, but this may not always be within
            our control. We shall provide the Service with reasonable skill and
            care, and we shall use reasonable efforts to make the Service
            available to You. If You experience problems with our Service or
            suspect fraudulent activity on your account, please contact the
            Customer Service immediately.<br/> We may from time to time and without
            notice, change the Service in order to comply with safety,
            regulatory, statutory and other requirements. We will try to ensure
            that this does not materially affect the scope of the Service.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Your obligations</h2>
          <p>
            You must use the Service in accordance with this Agreement and any
            other reasonable instructions we or the Customer Service give You
            from time to time. In particular, You are not authorized to use the
            SIM or eSIM in any other device than the device it was delivered
            with or supposed to be used with. It is also clarified that the SIM
            or eSIM remains the property of Esim and/or its chosen partners.<br/>
            You must disclose your country of residence to us when You open your
            Account. You must also provide us with a copy of your ID (national
            ID card or passport) before You first begin to use the services or
            at the latest within fifteen (15) days from the date You start using
            the Service. If not we reserve the right to suspend immediately the
            services. The eSIM or SIM does not have a PIN code by default.<br/> YOU
            ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING THE ACCESS TO YOUR SIM, AND
            YOU AGREE TO PAY FOR THE SERVICE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE AUTHORIZED
            SUCH USE. WE SHALL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR FRAUDULENT USE OF
            YOUR SIM or ESIM. If You believe that your SIM card is being used in
            an unauthorized manner, You must contact the Customer Service
            immediately so that the appropriate modifications can be made to
            your account. The eSIM or SIM is attributed to the first device
            owner. The first device owner remains liable for its use at any time
            unless Esim has received a proof of the change of the device’s
            ownership. The Service is intended to be used for web browsing,
            email, uploading and downloading applications, receive or make calls
            and content to and from the Internet or third-party applications,
            and using applications and content without excessively contributing
            to network congestion.<br/> You will not use the Service for any
            unlawful, abusive or fraudulent purpose, including, for example,
            using the Service in a way that (1) interferes with our ability to
            provide Service to You or other customers; (2) abuses any bonus or
            promotional program; or (3) avoids your obligation to pay for the
            Service.<br/> You will not use the Service in a way that compromises
            network security or capacity, excessively and disproportionately
            contributes to network congestion, adversely impacts network service
            levels or legitimate data flows, degrades network performance,
            causes harm to the network or other customers. You will not take any
            action that would, in Esim’s sole determination, interfere with
            the Service or other Esim customers, infringe the rights of any
            third party, or otherwise constitute objectionable conduct.<br/> If we
            have reasons to believe that You or someone else using your eSIM or
            SIM is abusing the Service or otherwise breaching this Agreement, we
            may immediately suspend, restrict, or cancel your SIM or ESIM and
            your ability to use the Service without notice. In addition, we
            reserve the right, at our sole discretion and for any reason, to (a)
            suspend, restrict, modify or terminate your SIM or ESIM and your
            access to and use of the Service and/or (b) refuse to allow You to
            buy any new Tariff Plans.<br/> You are responsible for all charges
            incurred on your account whether or not they are incurred by You
            personally except those incurred after You have notified the
            Customer Service of the loss or theft of your SIM card, and the
            Customer Service has acknowledged it in writing.

            Plan runs out (i.e. exhausted or expired), the access to Internet or
            voice will be automatically suspended. Your Tariff Plan will be
            debited per your usage of the Service (consuming your data and voice
            allowance). Tariff Plan allowances may only be used for our Service
            on your Device, and You will not be entitled to receive any cash
            refund for any remaining credit or allowance unless expressly stated
            otherwise in this Agreement.<br/> Credits and allowances are not
            transferable, and no interest will be payable on credit balances or
            allowances.
